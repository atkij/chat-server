# chat-server
A simple chat server written in node.js

## Installation
The chat server is written in javascript and can be run using node.js. I'm not sure which version can be used so install the latest version of node.js.

Clone the chat server repository
```
git clone https://github.com/j-a-13/chat-server.git
```

Make sure the fs, url and http module are installed.

## Running
To start the chat server  navigate to it's directory, and run
```
node server.js
```

You could also add a cron job to start it when your system starts.

## Notes
 - May not run on Windows I might add support for that later
 - Also has some easter eggs. See if you can find those :)
 - It now runs on Windows and probably Mac OSX too
